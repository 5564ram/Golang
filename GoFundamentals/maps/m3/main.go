/*
In the code above, in main at line 9, we make a slice of maps: items := make([]map[int]int, 5).
The declaration of items shows that it contains 5 maps. For each map, its keys will be of int type
and the values associated with its keys will also be of int type. Now, there is a for loop at line 10,
which iterates through all 5 places and places a map with the key 1( at line 11). For every map, the value
2 is assigned with the key 1( at line 12) as: item[i][1] = 2.

Now letâ€™s try a separate version. In the code above, in main at line 19, we make a slice of maps as:
items2 := make([]map[int]int, 5). The declaration of items2 shows that it contains 5 maps.
For each map, its keys will be of int type and values associated with its keys will also be of int type.
Now, there is a for loop at line 20, which iterates through all 5 places and places a map with the
key 1( at line 21). For every map, the value 2 is assigned with the key 1(at line 22) as :item[1] = 2.
The value will be lost in the next iteration because item is the copy of the slice; proper indexing is
required as done in Version 1 at line 12.
