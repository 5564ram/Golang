/*
In the code above, from line 6 to line 9, we define the interface Simpler by specifying
the signature of the functions Get and Set. The Get() function returns an integer, and
the Set(int) function takes an integer as a parameter. Note that because these are only
function descriptions, we do not have to specify variablesâ€™ names here.

The type Simple itself is defined from line 11 to line 13. It contains a field i of type int.
In order for Simple to implement the interface Simpler, it has to implement the functions Get
and Set as methods, working on a receiver argument p of type *Simple (see line 15 and line 19).
The Get will return the value of field i of p, as shown at line 16. The Set will take an integer
u and change p.i to this value, as shown at line 20.

Our test function fI (from line 23 to line 26) will take a parameter it of type Simpler and will
call both methods of Simpler. The parameter it will have to contain an integer field at the very
least (it could contain additional fields as well). We will first call Set (line 24) to give the
integer field an arbitrary value 5, and then return the value of the integer field with a call
to Get (line 25).

Finally, in main() we define a variable s of type Simple at line 29. Then, at line 30, we pass a
reference to s (&s) as a parameter to the test function fI. &s is required because Get() is defined
with a receiver type pointer *Simple. The function fI first sets s.i to 5, and then gets the value
of s.i, which is printed out.
