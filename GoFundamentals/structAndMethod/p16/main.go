/*
In the above code, we have a struct of type TwoInts with two integer fields a and b.
See the header of the String method at line 22 as: func (tn *TwoInts) String() string.
It shows that the variation of this function can be called on TwoInts type variables only.
It converts the fields of tn to string using the strconv package (imported at line 4) and
concatenating it with /, which in turn is placed with closed brackets. Then, it returns this string.

Now, look at main. We make a variable two1 of type TwoInts using the new() function at line 13.
In the next two lines, we assign the fields of two1: a and b with the values: 12 and 10.

At line 16, we are printing two1 using the Printf function of package fmt. The variation of the
String() method from line 22 will be called, and (12 / 10) will be returned and printed. In the
next line, we are printing two1 using Println function of package fmt. Notice the format specifier
is %T in this case. So, the type of two1 will be printed, which is *main.TwoInts. Now, at line 19,
we are printing two1 using the Printf function of package fmt. Notice the format specifier is %#v
in this case. This format specifier prints the type along with the values, so &main.TwoInts{a:12, b:10}
is printed.

If you make the mistake of defining String() in terms of itself, like in the following snippet,
then the program does an infinite recursion (TT.String() calls fmt.Sprintf which calls TT.String() â€¦)
and quickly gives an out of memory error:

type TT float64
func (t TT) String() string {
  return fmt.Sprintf("%v", t)
}
t.String()
